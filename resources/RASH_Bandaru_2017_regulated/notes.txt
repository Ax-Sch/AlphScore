In the first experiment, variants of wild-type H-Ras were expressed in the presence of the GAP and the GEF (a condition we refer to as ‘regulated-Ras’). In the next experiment, H-Ras variants were expressed with the GAP, but without the GEF (‘attenuated-Ras’). In the third experiment, variants of wild-type H-Ras were expressed without the GAP or the GEF (‘unregulated-Ras’). Finally, we examined the effects of an oncogenic mutation by expressing variants of H-Ras that contain the G12V mutation, without the GAP or the GEF (‘Ras-G12V’).
